## Designing a Market for Unlisted Properties


### What is Real Estate Rumors?
- a market for unlisted properties.
- a source of listing leads to realtors.
- a source of side-income and entertainment for general users

We let people buy properties they didn’t know they could buy
We let owners sell properties they didn’t know they could sell
We let agents find deals where they didn’t think there were listings.
